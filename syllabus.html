</div>
<div id="course-format" class="section level2">
<h2>Course Format</h2>
<p>The course will be taught using in a group-based and problem-focused
model. A typical class day will involve the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Reading/Video Assignment</em>. Every class will have an assigned
reading and pre-recorded lecture video, and you are expected to engage
with at least one of these media before each class. By 10am on the day
of the class period covering the given material, you will answer several
reflection question on those topics. You are also encouraged to submit
any questions you have on the readings/videos, or requests to review a
particular topic.</li>
<li><em>Active Class Session</em>. Our 50-minute meetings will include
mini-lectures by the instructor, along with collaborative group work
with your peers. The mini-lectures will provide supplementary content to
the assigned readings/videos, while the group work will allow you to
delve deeper into key problems and exercises.</li>
<li><em>Group Work</em>. After each class session, several homework
problems will be assigned, due on the following Monday by 11:59pm. At
least 1 problem from each in-class activity will be included on the
week’s homework.</li>
</ul>
<div id="workload" class="section level3">
<h3>Workload</h3>
<p>A prepared student will attend class for 50 minutes per day, three
days each week, and spend about two to four hours per day of class on
work outside the classroom (reading, watching lecture videos, doing
homework, discussing, studying, etc.). Together, this represents a 9 -
15 hour per week commitment.</p>
<hr />
</div>
</div>
<div id="grading-criteria" class="section level2">
<h2>Grading Criteria</h2>
<p>Your grade in the class will be determined by your proficiency in
each of the <em>Course Outcomes</em>, using the following weights:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Daily Assignments 10%</li>
<li>Homework 25%</li>
<li>Participation 15%</li>
<li>Midterm Exams 25% (12.5% each)</li>
<li>Final Exam 25%</li>
</ol>
<p>Letter grades will be assigned based on the following course
percentages (with upper and lower <span
class="math inline">\(2\%\)</span> of each division corresponding to
<span class="math inline">\(+ / -\)</span>, respectively).</p>
<ul>
<li>A: <span class="math inline">\(90 - 100\%\)</span></li>
<li>B: <span class="math inline">\(80 - 89\%\)</span></li>
<li>C: <span class="math inline">\(70 - 79\%\)</span></li>
<li>D: <span class="math inline">\(60 - 69\%\)</span></li>
<li>F: <span class="math inline">\(&lt; 60\%\)</span></li>
</ul>
<div id="daily-reading" class="section level3">
<h3>Daily Reading</h3>
<p>Probability intuition takes time to develop, and understanding
deepens upon revisiting a concept a <span
class="math inline">\(2^\text{nd}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(3^\text{rd}\)</span>, or <span
class="math inline">\(n^\text{th}\)</span> time. Studying basic
terminology and elementary examples in the textbook before class means
that class can be spent clarifying and expanding ideas, rather than
introducing them.</p>
<p>Daily assignments will be posted on the schedule page of the course
website, and will list the specific section(s) to read for each day,
along with a link to a pre-recorded lecture. A brief set of reflection
questions on the readings/videos will be included, to be completed by
10am each day of class (to give me time to review them before class).
These questions are not intended to be overly difficult, but should help
both you and I highlight topics that need further review. The assignment
will be assessed primarily on the basis of completion. <strong>No
extensions on daily reading will be given, but up to three assignments
may be missed without penalty.</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="homework" class="section level3">
<h3>Homework</h3>
<p>Homework will be due weekly on Mondays at 11:59pm, and should be
submitted online to Gradescope. Homework assignments may either be typed
and submitted as a .pdf file, or handwritten and scanned as an image. In
both cases, solution must be legible in order to recieve credit. Where
appropriate, solutions should be written in complete sentences, and be
thorough enough that another student in the class can follow your
reasoning without any question. <strong>Up to twice throughout the term,
an extension of up to four days may be requested on a homework
assignment. Except in extraordinary circumstances, requests must be made
prior to an assignment’s due date.</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="in-class-participation" class="section level3">
<h3>In-class Participation</h3>
<p>Because of the collaborative nature of this course, it is essential
that you strive to attend class every day, and that you complete the
assigned reading / video prior to the start of class. Additionally, in
order to foster a positive and inclusive classroom environment, you are
expected to follow our class code of conduct. Frequent absences, as well
as non-constructive in-class participation, will be reflected in your
final course grade.</p>
<p>If you aren’t able to attend class for any reason, please notify me
before the start of class so that I can make appropriate group
arrangements. <strong>Typically, you may miss up to three classes
without penalty. However, prolonged or recurring illness, as well as
other emergencies, may require individual adjustment, in which case you
should contact me to make appropriate arrangements.</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="midterm-exams" class="section level3">
<h3>Midterm Exams</h3>
<p>Two exams will be given during the term, and each will have both an
in-class and take-home component. Tentatively, the exams are scheduled
for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exam 1, Friday 9/30 (Week 6)</li>
<li>Exam 2, Friday 11/11 (Week 11)</li>
</ul>
<p>Take-home exams will be posted by 9am on Friday of the exam day and
due by 11:59pm the following Monday. They are intended to take between 2
and 3 hours to complete and allow reference to course notes and the
textbook. No homework will assigned the week of exams. <strong>Except in
the case of illness or emergency, requests to reschedule an in-class
exam must be made a week before the exam.</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="final-exam" class="section level3">
<h3>Final Exam</h3>
<p>The final exam will consist of two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A cumulative take-home final exam, published at 9am on Tuesday 12/13
and due by 5pm on Friday 12/16.</li>
<li>A brief oral exam, individually scheduled for a 20-minute block
during finals week.</li>

<h2>Community Information</h2>
<div id="accessibility" class="section level3">
<h3>Accessibility</h3>
<p>Grinnell College is committed to creating inclusive and accommodating
learning environments. Please notify me as soon as possible if there are
aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in
barriers to your participation. I also encourage you to have a
conversation about and provide documentation of your disability to the
Coordinator for Student Disability Resources, Jae Hirschman, located on
the 1st floor of Steiner Hall(x3089). If you have already been approved
for accommodations, please have Disability Resources provide a letter
during the first week of classes, or as soon as possible after approval.
I will then contact you to schedule a meeting during which we can
discuss the particular implementation of your accommodations.</p>
</div>
<div id="religious-observance" class="section level3">
<h3>Religious Observance</h3>
<p>Grinnell College offers alternative options to complete academic work
for studnets who observe religious holy days. Please contact me within
the first three weeks of the semester if you would like to discuss how
to meet the terms of your religious observance and also the requirements
for this course.</p>
</div>
<div id="academic-integrity" class="section level3">
<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>Students are allowed and encouraged to collaborate on most in-class
and homework assignments. However, any work that you turn in for grading
must be your own. If you collaborate on homework, you should clearly
indicate the names of your collaborators on the first page of your
assignment.</p>
<p>You are welcome to use other paper or internet resources to
supplement content we cover in this course; however, with the exception
of existing solutions to homework or exam problems. Copying or
paraphrasing solutions from the internet or other sources is an example
of academic dishonesty. Exams will explicitly mention what resources may
be consulted. All written work that references material outside of the
textbook or lecture should be accompanied by an appropriate
citation.</p>
</div>
<div id="code-of-conduct" class="section level3">
<h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
<p>I expect all members of the class to make participation a
harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size,
visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic
status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.</p>
<p>I expect everyone to act and interact in ways that contribute to an
open, welcoming diverse, inclusive, and healthy community of learners.
Examples of unacceptable behavior include: using sexualized language or
imagery, making insulting or derogatory comments, harassing someone
publicly or privately, monopolizing discussion or otherwise preventing
others from meaningfully participating. Instead you can contribute to a
positive learning environment by demonstrating empathy and kindness,
being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences, giving and
gracefully accepting constructive feedback, and making space for
everyone to contribute.</p>
</div>
<div id="assignment-feedback" class="section level3">
<h3>Assignment Feedback</h3>
<p>You will receive timely feedback on your homework via Gradescope,
usually within a week of the assignment’s due date. Each homework
problem can earn up to five points, and correspond loosely to letter
grades (5 points <span class="math inline">\(\approx\)</span> A, 4
points <span class="math inline">\(\approx\)</span> B, etc.)</p>
<p>I recommend you review comments on your solutions and rework missed
problems. You are welcome to talk to me about them during office hours
or via email.</p>
</div>
<div id="help" class="section level3">
<h3>Help</h3>
<p>I strongly encourage you to attend my office hours each week. You are
welcome to come either with specific questions, or just with general
uncertainties about content we’ve discussed. If you are unable to attend
scheduled office hours, please email me to schedule an alternative
appointment (either in-person or virtual).</p>
