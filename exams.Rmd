## Midterm Exams

Two exams will be given during the term, and each will have both an in-class and take-home component. Tentatively, the exams are scheduled for:

- Exam 1, Friday 9/30 (Week 6)
- Exam 2, Friday 11/11 (Week 11)

Take-home exams will be posted by 9am on Friday of the exam day and due by 11:59pm the following Monday. They are intended to take between 2 and 3 hours to complete and allow reference to course notes and the textbook. No homework will assigned the week of exams. **Except in the case of illness or emergency, requests to reschedule an in-class exam must be made a week before the exam.**

More information about the midterms (including logistics, topics and study guides) will be posted in the two weeks before the exam.
